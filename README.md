# Breast-Cancer-Classification
# Overview
This project focuses on classifying breast tumors as either benign or malignant using Support Vector Machines (SVM). By leveraging data and visualization techniques, the model delivers high accuracy in predicting tumor types, contributing to early and accurate breast cancer diagnosis.

# Featuers
- Classification of tumors into benign or malignant categories.
- Implementation of Support Vector Classification (SVC) for high-performance classification.
- Model tuning using GridSearchCV to achieve optimal results.
- Visualizations, including:
  - Confusion Matrix

  - Additional performance plots.

# Key Results
- Initial Accuracy: 97.3% using SVC.
- Optimized Accuracy: 98.2% after hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.

# Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:
   - Scikit-learn (for SVM and GridSearchCV)
   - Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
 
# Visualizations
- The project includes plots for:
    - Confusion Matrix: Displays the model's performance in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
    - Other Key Metrics: Performance evaluation through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score visualizations.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of SVM in medical diagnostics. By optimizing the model with GridSearchCV, it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, making it a reliable tool for classifying breast tumors.
